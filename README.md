jade-views
==========
Just some views using jade (also wrapping in angular.js stuff to keep it all together). Uses the [Almost Flat-UI](https://github.com/websymphony/almost-flat-ui/) UI

will try to keep this realistically modular, creating tons of folders is probably not the best way to go about it
